## Package name and metadata

[So _incredibly_ **wonderful!**](https://ropensci.org)

### Naming your package

* We strongly recommend short, descriptive names in lower case. 

### Naming your package

* If your package deals with one or more commercial services, please make sure the name does not violate branding guidelines. 

* You can check if your package name is available, informative and not offensive by using the [`available` package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/available). In particular, do _not_ choose a package name that's already used on CRAN or Bioconductor.

### Naming your package

* A more unique package name might be easier to track (for you and us to assess package use) and search (for users to find it and to google their questions). 

### Naming your package

* Obviously a _too_ unique package name might make the package less discoverable (e.g. it might be an argument for naming your package [geojson](https://github.com/ropensci/geojson)).
